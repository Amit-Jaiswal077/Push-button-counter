This Arduino project measures ambient temperature using a sensor and displays the readings on an LCD. A potentiometer adjusts the screen contrast, while the Arduino Uno processes data and updates the display in real time. It’s a beginner-friendly setup for learning sensor interfacing and microcontroller programming.
This Arduino-based temperature monitoring project showcases a practical application of sensor interfacing and real-time data visualization. The setup includes an Arduino Uno microcontroller connected to a breadboard, featuring an LCD display, a potentiometer, and a temperature sensor—likely an LM35 or DHT11. The temperature sensor reads ambient temperature and sends analog or digital signals to the Arduino, which processes the data and displays it on the LCD screen. The potentiometer is used to adjust the contrast of the LCD, ensuring clear visibility of the readings. Powered via USB, the Arduino acts as the brain of the system, continuously polling the sensor and updating the display. This project is ideal for beginners learning about microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and display modules. It can be extended to include features like data logging, threshold alerts, or wireless communication. The simulation environment, possibly Tinkercad, allows users to test and refine their circuit virtually before building it physically, making it a valuable tool for prototyping and education.
