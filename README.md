This Arduino project measures ambient temperature using a sensor and displays the readings on an LCD. A potentiometer adjusts the screen contrast, while the Arduino Uno processes data and updates the display in real time. It’s a beginner-friendly setup for learning sensor interfacing and microcontroller programming.
